--ABOUT--

Jets of Time is a remake of Wings of Time, intended to create faster seeds while taking more liberties with the gameplay. The progression has been altered greatly, and seeds can usually be beat within the 2:30:00 mark. The gameplay is *still* mostly classic Chrono Trigger, so being good at the base game helps a lot.

--USAGE--

Windows can directly run 'randomizer.exe' in the 'dist\randomizer' directory.  For other platforms, users should run randomizergui.py in the sourcefiles directory.  Python >=3.8 is required and can be obtained for free at https://www.python.org/downloads/. A commandline version can be run by providing the -c flag at runtime (i.e. by running 'python3 randomizergui.py -c' if your python command is 'python3' or 'randomizergui.exe -c' from the command line)

Lastly, if you're having trouble running the executable, you can try using the online seed generator at http://anguirel.ddns.net/jot/.  The online generator only supports up to version 3.1.
